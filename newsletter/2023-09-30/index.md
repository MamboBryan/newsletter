Hey there Droids and Droidettes! We know you missed us and we did too... ðŸ¥º We hope that you are excited for this episode as we have quite the comeback. From Machine Learning to Cyber Security, our speakers really outdid themselves by showing us just how versatile Android is. Wanna find out more? Grab a popcorn, take a coffee like the Techie you are, and brace yourself for this is Newsletter 13, The September Edition:

## September Meetup
Android254, in liaison with Kotlin Kenya, hosted the September Meetup which featured a new flavour of speakers: Musyoka Muasya (Mwalimu wa Maths), Oscar Karuga (Jamaa wa AI), and the Newsletter writer himself slash Android Security maverick Emmanuel MuturiaÂ®. They each gave their presentations on the following topics that demonstrated the diversity of Android App Development (AAD):

### Work in OfflineFirst Apps - Sync  Data Sources with Work Manager
Musyoka Muasya, the best Mathematical Developer in Kenya, gave a talk on Work Manager. He started off by reiterating on the functions and importance of Work Manager in the Android App Development workflow. Musyoka described the application of Work Manager in an offline-first environment through the use of a Closed Loop Control System which consisted of:

- Input
- Controller
- Process
- Output
- Feedback

Muasya supplemented his demonstration with a Test and Optimization Case that incorporated Mathematical functions. Do you think you are capable of mastering the Mathematics behind Work Manager? Well then, here is Musyoka's presentation for you to knock yourself out: [Click Me](https://www.slideshare.net/JosephMuasya2/work-in-offline-first-apps-sync-datasources-with-workmanagerpptx)

## Enhancing Android Apps with Machine Learning
Following that, Oscar Karuga took the stage and introduced the audience to Machine Learning in Android. The son of Jupyter gave an elaborate walkthrough on the use of accurate but comprehensive data sets to train a customised AI model. He concluded by showcasing his Android application that wowed the audience by accurately differentiating between various images based on the model that he had trained...

### Unlocking Passkeys in Android (feat Credentials Manager)
Wrapping up the presentation set was Emmanuel MuturiaÂ®, who gave a stellar presentation on Passkeys in Android using Credential Manager. Emmanuel began by educating the audience on Passkeys, and why they should be considered a necessary asset in modern Authentication. He then went over the high-level implementation of Passkeys in Android using the Credential Manager API as well as things to consider when doing so. To spice up his presentation, Emmanuel posed three questions to the audience and rewarded the winners so don't say we didn't warn you against attending his talks... ðŸ˜Œ
