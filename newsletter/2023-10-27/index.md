## The October Meetup
Android254, in liaison with Kotlin Kenya, hosted the October Meetup which was spearheaded by some of the community's fan favourite speakers: Jacquiline Gitau, Abdulfatah Mohammed, and Jane Waitara. They each gave their presentations on the following topics that demonstrated the diversity of Android App Development (AAD):

### The Art of Testing Composable Layouts
[The Droidette](https://twitter.com/Jacqui_Gitau) kicked off by introducing the audience to the different kinds of Testing, namely: Unit Tesing, Integration Testing, and UI Testing. She added onto that by going over Semantics in Compose and how they aid in testing Compose elements. She supplemented that by discussing API Tetsing, which incorporated:

- Finders
- Assertions
- Actions
- Matchers

Jacquiline concluded her session by showcasing a demo which also consisted of the libraries used in testing Compose elements...

### Why I Have Come To Love Feature Modularization
Following that, we had [The Modularizer](https://twitter.com/fatahrez) taking over and explaining the motivations behind Modularization. They were but not limited to:

- Presence of many moving parts in most fetaure packed Android apps
- Rapid replacement of libraries...
- Difficulty in connecting knowledge
- Adherance to good architectural practices

He supported his argument by mentioning how Modularization results in freedom to work on more features, increased productivity, easier onboarding, and opportunities for experimentation. He utilised his personal project to demonstrate the magic behind Modularization by Feature. Abdulfatah concluded by insisting that for a Modularization driven approach, it was best to always prioritise the UI over Architecture when structuring the Android app...

### Composing with Accessibility in Mind
To mark the day complete, we had [Mumbi Codes](https://twitter.com/mumbicodes) enlightening the attendees regarding the prioritisation of Accessibility when working on UI/UX. She began by acknowledging WHO's statistics which stated that between 15% to 20% of the world's population is categorised as people living with disabilities. She also cited some types of diabetes to give context on their need for specialised adjustments as far as Accessibility in Android was concerned. She listed the following as solutions to improving Accessibility in Android apps through Jetpack Compose:

- Visual Elements
- Headings
- Semantics
- Click Labels
- Touch Target Size
- Toggleable Selections
- Text

Jane used a practical approach to teach the above concepts by use of a Jetpack Compose project...
