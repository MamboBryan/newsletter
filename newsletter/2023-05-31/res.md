## Updates

### May 2023 Kotlin Challenge
As per the usual we have this month's challenge for those who'd like to test their mettle in the Kotlin language.

:::info
 This month we're giving away two Jetbrains licenses for the first two people to solve this month's challenge
:::

```kotlin
import junit.framework.TestCase.assertEquals
import junit.framework.TestCase.assertTrue

class PrintingScope(val separator: String = "|")

context(PrintingScope)
fun <K, V> Map<K,V>.customPrint(): String = this.map { (k,v) -> "$k:$v" }.joinToString("$separator")

fun main() {
    val scope = PrintingScope()
    val map = mapOf("a" to 1, "b" to 2, "c" to 3)
    assertEquals(
        "a:1|b:2|c:3", // expected
        evaluate(scope, map) // actual
    )
    println("Everything Passed!!!")
}

/**
 * Without changing anything above
 * Write an evaluate function that makes the test case pass
 */

```

:::tip 
You can start by creating the `evaluate` function
