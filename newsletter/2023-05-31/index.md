Hey there Droids and Droidettes! You've heard it all, yes? AI, Bard, at this rate we might just be starring in another episode of Love, Death and Robots (Well, especially the Love bit after Jack Siro's confession üòè)

## Google I/O Recap

The Google I/O Recap featured two speakers: [Theophillus Kibet](https://twitter.com/_kibetheophilus) and [Mambo Bryan](https://twitter.com/mambo_bryan). They gave presentations detailing the fresh and new updates made in Android:


### Android Highlights
Theo started off by highlighting the well-recieved Android 14 (Beta Version) which boasts susbstantial improvements, the main one being enhanced Privacy and Security. This was backed up by the Credential Manager which is set to utilise passkeys and passwords for a more security-driven sign in experience. Theo also talked about the latest updates and improvements in Jetpack Compose:

- Text improvements, mainly the native inclusion of Emojis üòú
- Flow  Layout improvements in both the Row and Column dimensions.
- Tooling enhancements which has teased the release of several tools, the most notable one being Studio Bot (Take that ChatGPT!)
- Introduction of Date and Time Pickers in Material Compose as well as Animations in Predictive Navigation.

Theo concluded by outlining and illustrating the newly released features of Google Play including the Update Prompt, Data Deletion (Privacy and Security), Ad Campaigns (Marketing), Inactive Users and Translations (Insights).

### Kotlin Updates
Mambo Bryan lit up Kotlin developers' hearts by announcing the new approach taken to build the latest Kotlin Compiler involving the full adoption of Kotlin as opposed to the *'J'* word. He emphasized how Kotlin 2.0 is projected to reduce build and compilation times, thus reiterating Kotlin's agenda of having _fun_ while coding. Mambo discussed the new Kotlin DSL features: Precise code hinting, optional version catalogs integration, more documentation and probably the most important one, real time error handling without need to sync the project (Groovy had it coming). Mambo finalised by announcing the importance of using KSP in future code generation as opposed to KAPT.

### Other Business
As if the talks weren't enough, the speakers joined by Tamre Frank, participated in a AMA (Ask Me Anything) which was moderated by Harun Wangereka who posed them juicy questions from Slido.com to which they heartily answered. BY THE WAY, the call for speakers for the monthly meetups is still on. Interested in giving a talk?

### May 2023 Kotlin Challenge
As per the usual we have this month's challenge for those who'd like to test their mettle in the Kotlin language.

:::info
 This month we're giving away two Jetbrains licenses for the first two people to solve this month's challenge
:::

```kotlin
import junit.framework.TestCase.assertEquals
import junit.framework.TestCase.assertTrue

class PrintingScope(val separator: String = "|")

context(PrintingScope)
fun <K, V> Map<K,V>.customPrint(): String = this.map { (k,v) -> "$k:$v" }.joinToString("$separator")

fun main() {
    val scope = PrintingScope()
    val map = mapOf("a" to 1, "b" to 2, "c" to 3)
    assertEquals(
        "a:1|b:2|c:3", // expected
        evaluate(scope, map) // actual
    )
    println("Everything Passed!!!")
}

/**
 * Without changing anything above
 * Write an evaluate function that makes the test case pass
 */

```

:::tip 
You can start by creating the `evaluate` function
