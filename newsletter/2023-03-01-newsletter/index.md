HolaðŸ‘‹ gritty engineers! As we've come to start of another month, we would like to bring you all up to speed with things that have been happening around our amazing android community.

Starting us off isâ€¦

## 1. Compose Camp Things.
After many years of imperative UI using Java and XML to render views on a screen, `compose` came to make it easier and simpler. Its not only declarative, but also saves time while creating the said components.

In February KotlinKenya, Android254 and WomenTechMakers Nairobi sought to focus more on UI frameworks by organizing interactive and helpful weekend sessions on `compose`. These sessions got the audience acquinted with common way of using `compose` and also the `Kotlin` language.

The app is a treasure trove even for the most seasoned developers. From excellent modularization to integrated testing. There are a number of issues added and we would love to see you add yours as well!
