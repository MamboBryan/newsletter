## Welcomes & Hellos!
If laughter is the best medicine then we are no doubt the best doctors in Kenya for our attendees had quite some laughs during The March Meetup courtesy of our lively speakers. Even if you did not get the chance to attend this month's sessions, worry not for this release will simulate them as we believe in leaving no man (or woman) behind. This is Newsletter #17:

## Keeping Your Software Fresh: How Renovate Simplifies Dependency Updates
Have you ever struggled to keep your dependencies up to date in this dynamic field of Android? or even worse, have you ever had to deal with Ancient Dependencies? We know for sure this developer had to and was not happy with it:

You would think that Dependabots were the only solution. What if we told you that there was another way? What if we told you that it prioritizes Automation? Yes, people of DevOps. This new option targets you too. Without wasting any time let us introduce you to: [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate). [Brandy](https://www.twitter.com/arianabrandy5) introduced Renovate as an automated solution that seeks to ease the process of Dependency Management. Say goodbye to Ancient Code (Interns and Juniors we are watching you) and say hello to Automation. In fact, we dare to say that Renovate might be better for you compared to Dependabots thanks to:

- Dependency Dashboard that provides all of the information you need regarding your dependencies...
- Ability to upgrade common monorepo packages...
- Multi-platform support...
- Ability to show log changes...
- Running as often as it is allowed to run...

## State Management in Jetpack Compose
Speaking of Ancient Code, are you still stuck writing your UI in XML and would like to migrate to Jetpack Compose? Would you like to take a step further and learn about State Management in Jetpack Compose? We had [The Beerman]() take us through State Management where he implemented [The Beer App]() to demonstrate the same. 

## Get Started with Gemini on Android
From ChatGPT to Dall-E and now Devin, AI seems to be moving faster than most of us thought. whether that is a good or bad thing, we cannot deny that AI is here to stay and we are all better off understanding it even at a basic level. Given that we do not want our developers to be rendered obsolete in terms of skill, we invited [Mrs. Gemini]() to host a workshop on Getting Started with Gemini on Android. she made use of [The Chat App]() to demonstrate the power of Machine Learning through artificial Intelligence. The audience was in awe for this marked a revolution of sorts in the potential of AI in building attractive, user-friendly, robust, and testable Android apps.

## DSA is Loading...
Are you a lover of Data Structures and Algorithms? Don't you just love a good LeetCode session where Performance and Optimization is your love language? Worry no more for if you like it or not, we decided to feature linked Lists in The March Challenge anyway. Oh no. We did not just stop there. Android254 and Kotlin Kenya firmly believes in Test Driven Development (TDD). "How does that relate with the March Challenge?" That is the best question you could have asked for all you need to do is [click me](https://kotlinbits.vercel.app/quiz/2024/March) to test your Testing skills. See what we did there?
