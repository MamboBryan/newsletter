Hey there Droids and Droidettes! I don't know about you but I could sure use a hot cup of coffee cause this weather...Anyway, whether you're reading this from Amsterdam or not, Newsletter 11 is already here!!!

## June Meetup
Android254 & Kotlin Kenya hosted the monthly Meetup (June Edition) which was spearheaded by three speakers: Kenn Jr, [Dennis Githuku](https://twitter.com/dennis_githuku) and [Kenneth Mathari](https://twitter.com/KennethMathari). They each gave amazing talks on three insightful concepts in modern Android Development:

### Notifications
Kenn Jr kicked off by introducing the audience to Notifications in Android. He differentiated Push and Local Notifications and engaged the audience by asking them to give examples of modern Android applications that use Notifications and how it impacts their users. Kenn emphasized the need for Android Developers to implement Notifications to result in the following:

- Re-Engage their users.
- Have higher retention rates...
- Facilitate direct marketing to their users...
- Understand their users' behaviours...
- Branding and Visibility...

Kenn concluded by demonstrating the impact of Notifications through a case study on Duolingo based on his personal use of the app.

### GraphQL
The sherehe master followed by orienting the audience to GraphQL, the alleged replacement for REST APIs. Kenneth's presentation largely involved a demo on how to implement GraphQL in an Android project. He also supported his demo by advising the audience to check out GraphQL's official documentation and the Apollo Developer Hub to learn more about GraphQL. Kenneth concluded by outlining the main benefit of GraphQL i.e The ability to only get the resources you want.

### Side Effects
Composers were in for a treat as the last session had Dennis Githuku talk about Side Effects in Jetpack Compose. He started off by debunking the myth that portrays Side Effects as the toughest concept to grasp in Jetpack Compose and how most Android Devs are using them without even knowing! He went on to give a Description-Demo sort of presentation on the following Side Effects:

- LaunchedEffect
- rememberCoroutineScope
- rememberUpdatedState
- DisposableEffect
- derivedStateOf
- SideEffect (Composable)
- produceState
- snapshotFlow

Dennis wrapped up his session by assuring the audience that contrary to how intimidating Side Effects appear, they really depend on an individual developer's use case and more often than not, using Side Effects in Jetpack Compose is unnecessary.

## DroidCon Kenya 2023
We were also reminded the meetup's attendees to RSVP for the DroidCon Kenya event that is set to run from 8th November to 10th November. We were urged not to delay as the Early Bird tickets are limited, after which any interested attendees may probably need to find a sponsor to finance their tickets. Have you RSVPd for the event? No? Are you even serious? Anyway, get your Early Bird tickets here and share with your friends cause this year we be happening: [Click Me](https://t.co/P50pBnrI92)
